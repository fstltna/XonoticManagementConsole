# Xonotic Management Console (1.5.0)
Allows you to manage your Xenotic server with a text based GUI -  Official support sites: [Official Github Repo](https://github.com/fstltna/XenoticManagementConsole) - [Official Forum](https://fps.gameplayer.club/index.php/forum/server-utilities)

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

Run "xmc". If you need to change any settings after this, edit "~/.xmcrc" and make the desired changes. This can be done within xmc itself.

You also need to have my Xonotic Startup Script and Xenotic Backup Script installed.

I then suggest you add this directory (XonoticManagementConsole) into your path, so that you can just run "git pull" to upgrade to the latest version xmc as updates come out.
